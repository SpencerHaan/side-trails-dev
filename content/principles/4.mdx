There are the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns. The latter emerges as a solution is developed. Something may not work as expected, or a problem is either simpler or more complicated than anticipated. A willingness to change course as needed can mean the difference between a solution that solves your problem and one that does not.

Flexibility can be enhanced during development by keeping solutions simple. Implement solutions quickly, prove out your ideas first, then move onto the next problem. Each problem solved adds to a greater understanding of the bigger picture. You might learn that past solutions weren't right, or that future solutions need to be adjusted.
