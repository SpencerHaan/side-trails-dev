Preemptive explanation is unnecessary. Any missing context or understanding can instead be requested as needed, allowing everyoneâ€™s understanding to develop and evolve more naturally, layer by layer.

Since all participants are in the same room, either in person or over video, at the same time, no one is waiting on a response. Prompts for clarification or misunderstanding can be addressed immediately.
