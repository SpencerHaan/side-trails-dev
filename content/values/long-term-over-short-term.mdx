I believe building solutions that hold up over time, and are easy to maintain and operate, are ideal over quicker, shorter-term solutions.

#### What this means

Short-term solutions may still be the right option in certain circumstances, but they should always be built with thought towards the future. Long-term solutions reduce overhead costs from maintenance or rework.
