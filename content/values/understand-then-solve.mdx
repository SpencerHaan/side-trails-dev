I believe that in order to solve problems well a strong understanding of that problem has to be established.

#### What this means

Asking questions. A lot of questions. This is a form of exploration, uncovering the problem in the same way an archaeologist would uncover a fossil. Close, on-going collaboration and iterative development is key to establishing both a deeper and shared understanding.
