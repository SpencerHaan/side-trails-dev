Long-term solutions reduce overhead costs from maintenance or rework.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"6e3f9cfb-5812-5f84-93cb-6b1ed09cfd68","frontmatter":{"title":"Deep understanding leads to better solutions","icon":"understanding"},"body":"\nI believe that in order to solve problems well a strong understanding of that problem has to be established.\n\n#### What this means\n\nAsking questions. A lot of questions. This is a form of exploration, uncovering the problem in the same way an archaeologist would uncover a fossil. Close, on-going collaboration and iterative development is key to establishing both a deeper and shared understanding.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"2e79214c-7002-5eb4-aa73-209a4af39d64","frontmatter":{"title":"Consider incentives and tradeoffs, not just solutions","icon":"tradeoffs"},"body":"\nI believe that most problems won't have perfect solutions, but come with tradeoffs and incentives that need to be considered.\n\n#### What this means\n\nMost problems can be solved in multiple ways, but what defines a high-quality solution is one that accounts for, and addresses, the tradeoffs and incentives.\n"}}]}}}
