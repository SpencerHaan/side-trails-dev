If something isn’t working as expected, it can be caught early and changed before it becomes more expensive and time consuming to do so down the road."}},{"childMdx":{"id":"237c7d04-d907-5283-8a87-a74f90c2b197","frontmatter":{"title":"Value comes from frequent collaboration and communication","icon":"number2"},"body":"\nOngoing collaboration ensures we stay on the right track. You and your team know the problems you’re trying to solve. You’re integral to the development process.\n\nRemoving unnecessary overhead by building a team around trusted, knowledgeable, and motivated individuals further increases the chances of delivering a valuable solution. Having a representative sample of the solutions users will guarantee that nothing gets missed.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"5d47b67d-5195-502d-8ff8-7337343d11c8","frontmatter":{"title":"Face-to-face communication increases speed and accuracy","icon":"number3"},"body":"\nPreemptive explanation is unnecessary. Any missing context or understanding can instead be requested as needed, allowing everyone’s understanding to develop and evolve more naturally, layer by layer.\n\nSince all participants are in the same room, either in person or over video, at the same time, no one is waiting on a response. Prompts for clarification or misunderstanding can be addressed immediately.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"2ba241d1-f178-56c9-89f5-1b5a47fddff1","frontmatter":{"title":"Changing requirements are inevitable, so be flexible","icon":"number4"},"body":"\nThere are the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns. The latter emerges as a solution is developed. Something may not work as expected, or a problem is either simpler or more complicated than anticipated. A willingness to change course as needed can mean the difference between a solution that solves your problem and one that does not.\n\nFlexibility can be enhanced during development by keeping solutions simple. Implement solutions quickly, prove out your ideas first, then move onto the next problem. Each problem solved adds to a greater understanding of the bigger picture. You might learn that past solutions weren't right, or that future solutions need to be adjusted.\n"}}]}}}
